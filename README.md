# Machine Learning Battle

Simple web application that allows you to run and track a simple, real-time, kaggle-like ML challenge.

## How to run

To run the project you just need to execute the command below:
```
docker-compose up  
```

</p>

## How to create datasets
The datasets need to be placed inside the folder 'datasets' where each one must have 2 files. NAME.x.npy and NAME.y.npy. Please check the file temp/create-dataset.py to learn how to create a new dataset.

The uploads folder will be used to store temporarily the models submitted.

## How to clear the database
The only way to delete submitted results is by manually editing the "database" file 'super-secure-database.json'. Have fun with that ;)

## How students will upload their models
Students need to upload the models serialized using the library joblib. please check the file temp/create-model.py to see how the students need to create the models:
```
from joblib import dump
dump(clf_lr, 'model.joblib')
```
To upload the model the student just need to use the "Submit Model" form:

## Common Errors
Here are some common errors you might encounter while using the application:

1. **Database Connection Error**: Ensure that the database file 'super-secure-database.json' is correctly formatted and accessible.
2. **Model Upload Error**: Make sure the model is serialized using joblib and follows the naming convention 'model.joblib'.
3. **Dataset Format Error**: Verify that your datasets are placed in the correct format (NAME.x.npy and NAME.y.npy) within the 'datasets' folder.
